data["text"] = In this piece we study complexity science in the context of Heliophysics,
describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of
Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary
environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary
surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a
system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a
society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these
interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is
inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15
orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well
beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary,
exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which
to explore complexity science.
  After first outlining the dimensions of complexity science, the review
proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity
Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established
foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely
beyond 2010.
  This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity
science in Heliophysics. The intention is to provide inspiration, help
researchers think more coherently about ideas of complexity science in
Heliophysics, and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics
researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the
frontier of systems and complexity science.


data["text"] = We describe the picture of physical processes suggested by Edward Nelson's
stochastic mechanics when generalized to quantum field theory, after an
introductory review of his theory applied to the hydrogen atom. By performing
numerical simulations of the relevant stochastic processes, we observe that
Nelson's theory provides an intuitive account of how particles can arise from
an underlying field ``beable'' -- to use a phrase of John S. Bell -- in the
case of free field theory, regularized on a lattice. We then argue that this
picture looks qualitatively similar when generalized to interacting scalar
field theory. Lastly, we compare the Nelsonian framework to various other
proposed ontologies for QFT, and remark upon their relative merits in light of
the effective field theory paradigm.


data["text"] = The fascinating story of a major discovery at CERN is outlined. The bold
decision to convert its most powerful, and only recently inaugurated, proton
accelerator to a proton-antiproton collider led to the discovery of the W and Z
bosons -- mediators of the weak interaction -- in a record time, at the
experiments UA1 and UA2. The decisive roles of Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der
Meer, who received the 1984 Nobel Prize for physics, are underlined.


data["text"] = A form of Landauer's Principle is shown to hold for thermal systems by
reference to the joint entropy associated with conjugate observables. It is
shown that the source of the compensating entropy for irreversible physical
processes is due to the irreducible uncertainty attending values of such
mutually incompatible observables. The relevant irreversibility is argued to be
that of quantum measurement rather than erasure of classical memory devices, as
commonly assumed.


data["text"] = This article proposes a mathematical model of an inverted analemmatic
sundial, provides formulas for calculating the coordinates of their hour
markers. On the example of the Belogorsk sundial, a method is described for
determining the accuracy of time measurement using an inverted analemmatic
sundial, in which cup marks are used as hour markers. The obtained value of the
accuracy of time measurement with the help of the Belogorsk sundial is 5 - 6
minutes and is quite good for a measuring instrument of the Bronze Age, and is
also higher than the accuracy of time measurement with the help of a water
clock. As a result, it is concluded that the hypothesis is confirmed that the
invention of the sundial was associated with the need to improve the accuracy
of time measurement using a water clock.


data["text"] = I revisit the long-running controversy as to the transformation properties of
temperature under Lorentz transformations, and argue that, contrary to
widespread views in some parts of the literature, `relativistic thermodynamics'
should not be understood as a generalization to relativistic physics of an
initially non-relativistic theory but as an application of a general
thermodynamic framework, neutral as to its spacetime setting, to the specific
case of relativity. More specifically, I observe that the general framework of
equilibrium thermodynamics incorporates arbitrary conserved quantities in
addition to energy and that when that framework is applied to systems in which
momentum is conserved and can be transferred between systems, it gives rise to
an unambiguous result as to the thermodynamics of moving (including
relativistically moving) systems. This leads to an equally unambiguous
prediction as to how thermodynamic temperature transforms under Lorentz
transformations (an answer coinciding with Einstein's, and Planck's, original
results.) That said, one can identify within this framework other quantities
which play a temperature-like role and have different transformation
properties; at some level it is a matter of convention and semantics which is
`the' temperature. I conclude with some brief remarks about the situation in
general relativity.


data["text"] = We show that the quantum wavefunctional can be seen as a set of classical
fields on the 3D space aggregated by a measure. We obtain a complete
description of the wavefunctional in terms of classical local beables. With
this correspondence, classical explanations of the macro level and of
probabilities transfer almost directly to the quantum. A key difference is
that, in quantum theory, the classical states coexist in parallel, so the
probabilities come from self-location uncertainty. We show that these states
are distributed according to the Born rule. The coexistence of classical states
implies that there are many worlds, even if we assume the collapse postulate.
This leads automatically to a new version of the many-worlds interpretation in
which the major objections are addressed naturally. We show that
background-free quantum gravity provides additional support for this proposal
and suggests why branching happens toward the future.


data["text"] = We train a generative language model on the randomized local measurement data
collected from Schr\"odinger's cat quantum state. We demonstrate that the
classical reality emerges in the language model due to the information
bottleneck: although our training data contains the full quantum information
about Schr\"odinger's cat, a weak language model can only learn to capture the
classical reality of the cat from the data. We identify the quantum-classical
boundary in terms of both the size of the quantum system and the information
processing power of the classical intelligent agent, which indicates that a
stronger agent can realize more quantum nature in the environmental noise
surrounding the quantum system. Our approach opens up a new avenue for using
the big data generated on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to
train generative models for representation learning of quantum operators, which
might be a step toward our ultimate goal of creating an artificial intelligence
quantum physicist.


data["text"] = In this paper I argue that the fundamental aspect of our notion of time is
that it defines an order relation, be it a total order relation between
configurations of the world or just a partial order relation between events.
This position is in contrast with a relationalist view popular in the quantum
gravity literature, according to which it is just correlations between physical
quantities that we observe and which capture every aspect of temporality in the
world, at least according to general relativity. I argue that the view of time
as defining an order relation is perfectly compatible with the way general
relativity is applied, while the relationalist view has to face some
challenges. This debate is important not only from the perspective of the
metaphysics of space and time and of how to interpret our physical theories,
but also for the development and understanding of theories of quantum gravity.


data["text"] = Dennis Sciama argued that the existence of life depended on many quantities,
the fundamental constants, so in a random universe life should be highly
unlikely. However, without full knowledge of these constants, his argument
implies a universe that would appear to be `intelligently designed.'
